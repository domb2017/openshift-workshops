### What's A/B Testing?

A/B testing is **NOT** blue-green deployments. A/B testing is a way of testing features in your application for various reasons like usability, popularity, noticeability, etc, and how those factors influence the bottom line. Itâ€™s usually associated with UI parts of the app, but of course the backend services need to be available to do this. You can implement this with application-level switches (ie, smart logic that knows when to display certain UI controls), static switches (in the application), and also using Canary releases (as discussed below).

The difference between blue-green deployments and A/B testing is A/B testing is for measuring functionality in the app. Blue-green deployments is about releasing new software safely and rolling back predictably. You can obviously combine them: use blue-green deployments to deploy new features in an app that can be used for A/B testing.

### Let's Try It!
This demo will show how to use OpenShift's built in HAProxy capabilities to load balance across two Node.js apps.

Create basic node.js web app w/ git repo from a previous commit.

    oc new-app https://github.com/kyle-benson/ocp-nodejs-demo.git#b69a1b0f0c3195baa0dbd2ff600f8bebc38c7ade --name='appa'

:warning: Do not create a route automatically for this exercise.

Create a route to the deployed application.

    oc expose svc/appa --name="appab" --hostname=appab.

Begin using `curl` against the newly exposed route.


    while true; do curl appab-balanced.master.kbenson.co && echo && sleep 5; done

:information_source: Keep this command alive (it'll be used later on in this lab).

Update the current Route's annotation.

    oc get routes
    oc annotate route/appab haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin

Create second nodejs app from new branch or updated commit.

    oc new-app https://github.com/kyle-benson/ocp-nodejs-demo.git --name="app2"

Setup route to load balance between `appA` & `appB`.

Observe the previous started while loop, notice anything different?
